/**
 * This class provides a workaround for bugs in the Windows implementation of
 * {@link JFileChooser} causing certain operations to deadlock.<br />
 * The deadlock pattern is always as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The operation begins on the AWT EventQueue thread
 * <li>It launches another operation on the Swing-Shell daemon thread
 * <li>It waits for the Swing-Shell thread to finish the requested operation
 * <li>The Swing-Shell thread blocks waiting for a monitor that was locked earlier by
 * the AWT EventQueue thread.
 * </ul>
 * To work around this, these deadlock-prone operations are performed on a separate
 * thread and polled to detect the deadlock. If the deadlock occurs, the thread is
 * interrupted allowing the Swing-Shell thread to finish whatever it was doing, then
 * the operation is retried. Experience shows that in most cases, a retry is successful
 * - presumably due to the Swing-Shell thread executing repeated requests faster, or
 * without requiring the same locks again.<br />
 * Note that this code is entirely built upon experimental evidence and therefore there
 * can be no guarantee that it does what it is intended to do. On platforms other than
 * Windows, it behaves identically to JFileChooser.<br />
 * See Sun bugs 6741890, 6744953, and 6789084.
