; DAHDI Telephony Configuration file
;
; You need to restart Asterisk to re-configure the DAHDI channel
; CLI> module reload chan_dahdi.so
;      will reload the configuration file, but not all configuration options
;      are re-configured during a reload (signalling, as well as PRI and
;      SS7-related settings cannot be changed on a reload).
; 
; This file documents many configuration variables.  Normally unless you know
; what a variable means or that it should be changed, there's no reason to
; un-comment those lines.
;
; Examples below that are commented out (those lines that begin with a ';' but
; no space afterwards) typically show a value that is not the default value,
; but would make sense under certain circumstances. The default values are
; usually sane. Thus you should typically not touch them unless you know what
; they mean or you know you should change them.

; On UK analog lines, the caller hanging up determines the end of calls.  So
; Asterisk hanging up the line may or may not end a call (DAHDI could just as
; easily be re-attaching to a prior incoming call that was not yet hung up).
; This option changes the hangup to wait for a dialtone on the line, before
; marking the line as once again available for use with outgoing calls.
;waitfordialtone=yes
;
; The following option enables receiving MWI on FXO lines.  The default
; value is no.
; 	The mwimonitor can take the following values
;		no - No mwimonitoring occurs. (default)
; 		yes - The same as specifying fsk
; 		fsk - the FXO line is monitored for MWI FSK spills
;		fsk,rpas - the FXO line is monitored for MWI FSK spills preceded
;			by a ring pulse alert signal.
;		neon - The fxo line is monitored for the presence of NEON pulses
;			indicating MWI.   
; When detected, an internal Asterisk MWI event is generated so that any other
; part of Asterisk that cares about MWI state changes is notified, just as if
; the state change came from app_voicemail.
; For FSK MWI Spills, the energy level that must be seen before starting the
; MWI detection process can be set with 'mwilevel'.
;
;mwimonitor=no
;mwilevel=512
;
; This option is used in conjunction with mwimonitor.  This will get executed
; when incoming MWI state changes.  The script is passed 2 arguments.  The

; there are messages waiting or not.

;
; Whether or not to enable call waiting on internal extensions
; With this set to 'yes', busy extensions will hear the call-waiting

; See dialplan function CALLERID(pres) for more information.
; Only applies to PRI and SS7 channels.
;
usecallingpres=yes
;
; Some countries (UK) have ring tones with different ring tones (ring-ring),

;   Support flash-hook call transfer (requires three way calling)
;   Also enables call parking (overrides the 'canpark' parameter)
;
; For digital ports using ISDN PRI protocols:
;   Support switch-side transfer (called 2BCT, RLT or other names)
;   This setting must be enabled on both ports involved, and the
;   'facilityenable' setting must also be enabled to allow sending
;   the transfer to the ISDN switch, since it sent in a FACILITY
;   message.

; Whether or not to support Call Return (*69, if your dialplan doesn't
; catch this first)
;
callreturn=yes
;
; Stutter dialtone support: If a mailbox is specified without a voicemail 
; context, then when voicemail is received in a mailbox in the default 
; voicemail context in voicemail.conf, taking the phone off hook will cause a
; stutter dialtone instead of a normal one. 
;
; If a mailbox is specified *with* a voicemail context, the same will result
; if voicemail received in mailbox in the specified voicemail context.
;
; for default voicemail context, the example below is fine:
;
;mailbox=1234
;
; for any other voicemail context, the following will produce the stutter tone:
;
;mailbox=1234@context 
;
; Enable echo cancellation 
; Use either "yes", "no", or a power of two from 32 to 256 if you wish to
; actually set the number of taps of cancellation.
;
; Note that when setting the number of taps, the number 256 does not translate
; to 256 ms of echo cancellation.  echocancel=256 means 256 / 8 = 32 ms.
;
; Note that if any of your DAHDI cards have hardware echo cancellers,
; then this setting only turns them on and off; numeric settings will
; be treated as "yes". There are no special settings required for
; hardware echo cancellers; when present and enabled in their kernel
; modules, they take precedence over the software echo canceller compiled
; into DAHDI automatically.
;
;
echocancel=yes
;
; Some DAHDI echo cancellers (software and hardware) support adjustable
; parameters; these parameters can be supplied as additional options to
; the 'echocancel' setting. Note that Asterisk does not attempt to
; validate the parameters or their values, so if you supply an invalid
; parameter you will not know the specific reason it failed without
; checking the kernel message log for the error(s) put there by DAHDI.
;
;echocancel=128,param1=32,param2=0,param3=14
;
; Generally, it is not necessary (and in fact undesirable) to echo cancel when
; the circuit path is entirely TDM.  You may, however, change this behavior
; by enabling the echo canceller during pure TDM bridging below.
;
echocancelwhenbridged=yes
;
; In some cases, the echo canceller doesn't train quickly enough and there
; is echo at the beginning of the call.  Enabling echo training will cause
; DAHDI to briefly mute the channel, send an impulse, and use the impulse
; response to pre-train the echo canceller so it can start out with a much
; closer idea of the actual echo.  Value may be "yes", "no", or a number of
; milliseconds to delay before training (default = 400)
;
; WARNING:  In some cases this option can make echo worse!  If you are
; trying to debug an echo problem, it is worth checking to see if your echo
; is better with the option set to yes or no.  Use whatever setting gives
; the best results.
;
; Note that these parameters do not apply to hardware echo cancellers.
;
;echotraining=yes
;echotraining=800
;
; If you are having trouble with DTMF detection, you can relax the DTMF
; detection parameters.  Relaxing them may make the DTMF detector more likely
; to have "talkoff" where DTMF is detected when it shouldn't be.
;
;relaxdtmf=yes
;
; You may also set the default receive and transmit gains (in dB)
;
; Gain Settings: increasing / decreasing the volume level on a channel.
;                The values are in db (decibells). A positive number
;                increases the volume level on a channel, and a
;                negavive value decreases volume level.
;
;                There are several independent gain settings:
;   rxgain: gain for the rx (receive - into Asterisk) channel. Default: 0.0
;   txgain: gain for the tx (transmit - out of Asterisk Asterisk) channel. 
;           Default: 0.0
;   cid_rxgain: set the gain just for the caller ID sounds Asterisk
;               emits. Default: 5.0 .

;rxgain=2.0
;txgain=3.0
;
; Logical groups can be assigned to allow outgoing roll-over.  Groups range
; from 0 to 63, and multiple groups can be specified. By default the
; channel is not a member of any group.
;
; Note that an explicit empty value for 'group' is invalid, and will not
; override a previous non-empty one. The same applies to callgroup and
; pickupgroup as well.
;
group=1
;
; Ring groups (a.k.a. call groups) and pickup groups.  If a phone is ringing
; and it is a member of a group which is one of your pickup groups, then
; you can answer it by picking up and dialing *8#.  For simple offices, just
; make these both the same.  Groups range from 0 to 63.

;
; On trunk interfaces (FXS) and E&M interfaces (E&M, Wink, Feature Group D
; etc, it can be useful to perform busy detection either in an effort to 
; detect hangup or for detecting busies.  This enables listening for
; the beep-beep busy pattern.
;
;busydetect=yes
;
; If busydetect is enabled, it is also possible to specify how many busy tones
; to wait for before hanging up.  The default is 3, but it might be
; safer to set to 6 or even 8.  Mind that the higher the number, the more
; time that will be needed to hangup a channel, but lowers the probability
; that you will get random hangups.
;
;busycount=3
;
; If busydetect is enabled, it is also possible to specify the cadence of your
; busy signal.  In many countries, it is 500msec on, 500msec off.  Without
; busypattern specified, we'll accept any regular sound-silence pattern that
; repeats <busycount> times as a busy signal.  If you specify busypattern,
; then we'll further check the length of the sound (tone) and silence, which
; will further reduce the chance of a false positive.
;
;busypattern=500,500
;
; NOTE: In make menuselect, you'll find further options to tweak the busy
; detector.  If your country has a busy tone with the same length tone and
; silence (as many countries do), consider enabling the
; BUSYDETECT_COMPARE_TONE_AND_SILENCE option.
;
; To further detect which hangup tone your telco provider is sending, it is
; useful to use the dahdi_monitor utility to record the audio that main/dsp.c
; is receiving after the caller hangs up.

; Use a polarity reversal to mark when a outgoing call is answered by the
; remote party.
;
;answeronpolarityswitch=yes

;
; On trunk interfaces (FXS) it can be useful to attempt to follow the progress
; of a call through RINGING, BUSY, and ANSWERING.   If turned on, call

;
; Few zones are supported at the time of this writing, but may be selected
; with "progzone".

;   ca (alias for 'us')
;   cr (Costa Rica)
;   br (Brazil, alias for 'cr')
