<!--
Abstract :
Build the Charging-Rule-Install AVP.
Rules are grouped in the same Charging-Rule-Install according to the value of the tuple
(Rule-Activation-Time, Rule-Deactivation-Time, ...).

Input parameters :
- [CCAwithCRI[j]] : boolean, true if CCA is sent with Charging-Rule-Install AVP.
- [install[j]RuleNames] : list of PCC rules pre-defined at the PCEF
- [install[j]BaseNames] : list of of a pre defined groups of PCC rules residing at the PCEF.
- [install[j]ActivationTime] : value of Rule-Activation-Time AVP.
- [install[j]DeactivationTime] : value of Rule-Deactivation-Time AVP.

Output parameters : none.

Another used include :
- install[j]ChargingRuleDefinition[k] (with k=01..05).
